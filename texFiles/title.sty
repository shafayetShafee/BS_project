Children are the cornerstone of a country's long-term development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focuses on ensuring the highest possible quality of early childhood development (ECD) and a child's socio-emotional development is a crucial component of childhood development. Child's socio-emotional is facilitated by stimulating caregiving activities. This study aimed to assess the association between caregivers' stimulation activities and child's socio-emotional development in Bangladesh using data from latest round of Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS 2019). The sample comprised 9445 children aged 3 and 4 years. Children were considered to be on track with respect to socio-emotional development if they got along well with other children, did not kick or bite other children, and did not get easily distracted. Caregivers' stimulation level was derived from six stimulation activities and was measured by the number of different activities that the caregivers engaged in with the child in the 3 days preceding the survey. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between child's socio-emotional development and caregivers' stimulation level after adjusting for possible individual and demographic background characteristics.A second model was fit containing binary covariates representing each of the six stimulation activities to investigate their separate effects on the outcome. This study found that caregivers' stimulation level is negatively associated with child's socio-emotional development and among the various activities, only singing with child was found to be positively associated with the outcome. The study concludes that the type of activity and not the number of activities, is perhaps more important in positively influencing socio-emotional development in under-five children. Since the data used are cross sectional, causality can not be drawn from this association. Additional thorough cohort studies are required to fully comprehend the association at question.
